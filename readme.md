# JavaScript Snippets

## Description

This is just a repo where I store codes that I've done as random practice or as parts of larger projects.
* spacebetween.js: function that takes a string and adds " " between each character
* isanaofpal.js: function that determines whether a word is an anagram of a palindrome
